                Welcome to my portfolio site! My name is Sam, and I'm currently a computer science major at Yeshiva University. I've always had a passion for software engineering and building things, and over the years, I've had the opportunity to work on some exciting projects.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Currently, I am working on KitaHub, a project addressing challenges in STEM education and recruitment. KitaHub ensures students’ code is tested in a standardized environment, mirroring the instructor’s setup, and enhances real-time communication and collaboration with a modern discussion board. Additionally, it provides recruiters with insights based on genuine academic performance and interactions, bridging the gap between academic achievement and career advancement.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                One of my most significant accomplishments has been ImIn, a course registration software designed specifically for YU students. ImIn streamlines the registration process, making it easier, faster, and more efficient for students to enroll in the courses they desire. Through ImIn, I was able to put my skills in software development and project management to the test, and I'm proud of what I was able to accomplish.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                The summer of 2024, I interned at Cognizant as a Software Engineer, where I partnered with a team of interns to develop comprehensive Power BI reports from petabytes of healthcare data, enabling insurance companies to enhance population health and boost revenue. I utilized Python scripting and machine learning tools to extract deep insights from complex datasets, driving data-driven decision-making.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Previously, I also gained valuable experience as a part-time junior developer at SIDEARM Sports, where I contributed to the complete overhaul of the company’s CMS product and enhanced the user experience on the NCAA Tickets website.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Overall, I'm passionate about software engineering and the power of technology to solve real-world problems. I'm always eager to take on new challenges and explore new possibilities, and I'm excited to see what the future holds!
                <br/>

                    For ImIn, I developed a streamlined registration system specifically designed for students at Yeshiva University. Recognizing the high stress levels associated with registration periods, I crafted a solution to alleviate this pressure. My system allowed students to input their registration details months in advance, automatically registering them for their desired classes within approximately eight milliseconds once their registration slot opened. Impressively, nearly half of the student body utilized the app within its first month of launch. Through this project, I gained valuable experience in designing, building, and debugging a distributed system using AWS services such as EC2, Lambda, DynamoDB, and S3.

                    As a volunteer for Our Family First, I developed their online presence to support their mission. Our Family First provides essential mental health support to Israeli military personnel, including psycho-educational workshops and couples counseling during overnight retreats. Our goal is to address mental health, marital, and parenting issues for Israeli Soldiers as they reintegrate into family life after experiencing traumatic events in combat. By building their website, I helped facilitate a platform where these brave individuals can access the resources they need to achieve security and stability within their families, ensuring they can return to their duties with a clear mind and unwavering focus.
